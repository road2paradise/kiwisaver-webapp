Making the most of your KiwiSaver
Thinking Outside the Box

### Problem

KiwiSaver enrolments of the age group 14-19 are steadily decreasing.
Teenagers do not have enough understanding of KiwiSaver and how it could help them plan for their future.
There are very limited mediums and resources for teenagers to learn about KiwiSaver without encountering unfamiliar jargon and sophisticated concepts.

### Solution

By creating an engaging, interactive, fun-to-play visualisation tool customised to our target audience, we bridge the communication gap between teenagers and government.
This application is designed to be a journey planner, where the customer will start their adventure by setting up their goals for the future. Using the data related to their aspirations, the app provides visualised information about how KiwiSaver could be their best friend along their journey. To make it more engaging, we created `Hedwig the owl` who will be the user's companion and assistant. Hedwig will introduce important information about KiwiSaver and the significance of early investment. The uniqueness of the app, comes from the data visualisations, where users would not be puzzled by the jargon or abstract values of savings, but will be presented with clear, impactful and meaningful graphs, which can be easily interpreted by anyone even with basic levels of financial/mathematical literacy.
Ultimately the app will increase teenagers' awareness of KiwiSaver, its benefits and the importance of it.

# Data Story

The data our team has used for our project mainly comes from `Stats.NZ`. The data resources are limited and we try to make our predictions as accurate as possible.
Future work utilising the data includes creating an API to provide real-time information.
